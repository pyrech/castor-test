    <i>Castor is a <strong><abbr title="Developer eXperience">DX</abbr> oriented task
    runner</strong> built in PHP featuring a range of functions for common task processing.</i>
</p>

It can be viewed as an alternative to Makefile, Fabric, Invoke, Shell scripts,
etc., but it leverages PHP's scripting capabilities and its extensive library ecosystem.

It comes with many features to make your life easier:

* Seamless parsing of **arguments and options**, simplifying input handling
* **Autocomplete** support for faster and error-free typing
* A built-in list of useful functions:
    * [`run()`](doc/getting-started/run.md#the-run-function): Runs external processes, enabling seamless integration with external tools
    * [`parallel()`](doc/going-further/helpers/parallel.md#the-parallel-function): Parallelizes process execution to maximize resource utilization
    * [`watch()`](doc/going-further/helpers/watch.md): Watches files and automatically triggers actions on file modifications
    * [`log()`](doc/going-further/helpers/log.md#the-log-function): Captures and analyzes essential information
    * [And even more advanced functions](doc/06-reference.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Castor is still in early development, and the API is not stable yet. Even if
> it not likely to change, it is still possible that it will change in the
> future.

## Usage

In Castor, tasks are set up as typical PHP functions marked with the `#[AsTask()]` attribute in a `castor.php` file.

These tasks can run any PHP code but also make use of various [functions for standard operations](doc/reference.md) that come pre-packaged with Castor.

For example:

```php
<?php

namespace greetings;

use Castor\Attribute\AsTask;
use function Castor\run;

#[AsTask()]
function hello(): void
{
    run('echo "Hello from castor"');
}
```

Will expose a `greetings:hello` task that you can run with `castor greetings:hello`:

```bash
$ castor greetings:hello
Hello from castor
```

Then, you can go wild and create more complex tasks:

```php
#[AsTask(description: 'Clean the infrastructure (remove container, volume, networks)')]
function destroy(bool $force = false)
{
    if (!$force) {
        io()->warning('This will permanently remove all containers, volumes, networks... created for this project.');
        io()->comment('You can use the --force option to avoid this confirmation.');

        if (!io()->confirm('Are you sure?', false)) {
            io()->comment('Aborted.');

            return;
        }
    }

    run('docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans --volumes --rmi=local');

    notify('The infrastructure has been destroyed.')
}
```

usage](doc/getting-started/basic-usage.md) documentation, or browse the [examples](examples)
directory.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Castor requires PHP >= 8.1 to run.

### As a phar - recommended way

You can download the latest release of Castor as a phar file from the [releases
page](https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases).

We provide different phar for Unix/Windows architectures to offer lighter phar
files. Download the correct one and make it available in your shell:

Example for Linux:
```bash
curl "https://github.com/jolicode/castor/releases/latest/download/castor.linux-amd64.phar" -Lfso $HOME/.local/bin/castor && \
    chmod u+x $HOME/.local/bin/castor && \
    castor --version || \
    (echo "Could not install castor. Is the target directory writeable?" && (exit 1))
```

There are other ways to install Castor, please refer to the
[documentation](doc/getting-started/installation.md).

## Questions and answers

### How is Castor different from raw Symfony Console usage?

Castor is a task runner, so it's primary goal is to run simple tasks to simplify
the project development. Usually, it is used to run Docker commands, database
migrations, cache clearing, etc.

Usually, tasks are very small, like 1 or 2 lines of code. So you probably don't
want to waste your project with ops command that are not strictly related to the
business.

### Why "Castor"?

Castor means "beaver" in french. It's an animal building stuff. And this is what
this tool does: it helps you build stuff üòÅ
