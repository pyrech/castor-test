# Examples

## Builtin examples

Castor's repository provides a bunch of usage examples in the
[examples directory](https://github.com/jolicode/castor/tree/main/examples).
These examples are useful to show different Castor features in action, do not
hesitate to browse them.

As a side note, these examples also act as a full test suite for Castor to
ensure each feature works as expected.

## Real-world examples

Here is a partial list of real-world projects using Castor:

- [Castor itself](https://github.com/jolicode/castor/blob/main/castor.php)
- [Docker starter](https://github.com/jolicode/docker-starter/blob/main/castor.php)

Using Castor in one of your public projects? Feel free to contact us, we might
add it to this list.
